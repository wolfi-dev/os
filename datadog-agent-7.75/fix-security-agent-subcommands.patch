Description: Fix SecurityAgentSubcommands function call to variable reference

In DataDog Agent 7.74.0, SecurityAgentSubcommands was changed from a function
to a variable in cmd/security-agent/subcommands/subcommands.go, but the calling
code in cmd/agent/security_agent.go was not updated to match this change.

This patch removes the function call parentheses to treat SecurityAgentSubcommands
as a variable rather than a function.
