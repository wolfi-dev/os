Subject: [PATCH] Fixed bug when specifying a delay

The division in the 'loop' calculation in perform() was returning floating point values
after the migration to Python 3, rather than rounding down. Changed to floor division.

I think the floating point values kept 'loop == 0' from ever being
true and the variables inside that conditional were never initialized,
causing the following error when a delay other than 1 was specified:

You did not select any stats, using -cdngy by default.
