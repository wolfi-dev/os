      replaces:
        # A "replaces" must match the package origin's full name. Since we use
        # a version stream for fluent-bit, we must append fluent-bit-3.1
        # exactly.
        #
        # Our automation has no way of linking fluent-operator to
        # fluent-bit updates, so to ensure this doesn't silently fail when
        # fluent-bit rolls forward, we have a test stanza below that ensures
        # fluent-operator can always be installed alongside fluent-bit.
        #
        # When this test fails, that likely means fluent-bit rolled forward to
        # a new version stream anad must be updated in the "replaces" block
        # below
        #
        # Both fluent-bit and fluent-operator doesn't follow same versioning
        # and resulting inconsistency for the replaces block, so we have to
        # use always latest version of fluent-bit here.
