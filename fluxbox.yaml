# Upstream repository no longer cuts any tags or releases (since 2015). The
# last tag cut was v1.3.7 back in 2015, but there have been several commits
# since then, including fixes to compile against gcc 11+. This is why updates
# are disabled, as we're fixing to a given commit ID in the main branch.
