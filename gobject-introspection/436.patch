+ *
+ * In the event that the application is marked
+ * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE the "normal processing" will
+ * send the @options dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
+ * read with g_application_command_line_get_options_dict().  The signal
+ * handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
+ * modified dictionary will be sent.
+ *
+ * In the event that %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is not set,
+ * "normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
+ * line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
+ * the application is activated by g_application_activate().  One or
+ * more arguments results in a call to g_application_open().
+ *
+ * If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
+ * by converting them to calls to g_application_open() or
+ * g_action_group_activate_action() then you must be sure to register
+ * the application first.  You should probably not call
+ * g_application_activate() for yourself, however: just return -1 and
+ * allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
+ * the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
+ * in that case).
+ *
+ * Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
+ * local_command_line().  If you override that function and don't
+ * chain up then this signal will never be emitted.
+ *
+ * You can override local_command_line() if you need more powerful
+ * capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not

+ *
+ * Returns: an exit code. If you have handled your options and want

+ * emitted in the thread that cancelled the operation, not the
+ * thread that is running the operation.
+ *
+ * Note that disconnecting from this signal (or any signal) in a

+ * it is possible that a signal handler may be invoked even after
+ * a call to g_signal_handler_disconnect() for that handler has
+ * already returned.
+ *
+ * There is also a problem when cancellation happens right before

+ * the signal leaves a race condition where this is still happening.
+ *
+ * In order to make it safe and easy to connect handlers there
+ * are two helper functions: g_cancellable_connect() and
+ * g_cancellable_disconnect() which protect against problems
+ * like this.

+ * ]|
+ *
+ * Note that the cancelled signal is emitted in the thread that

+ *
+ * #GIOExtensionPoint provides a mechanism for modules to extend the
+ * functionality of the library or application that loaded it in an
+ * organized fashion.
+ *
+ * An extension point is identified by a name, and it may optionally
+ * require that any implementation must be of a certain type (or derived
+ * thereof). Use g_io_extension_point_register() to register an
+ * extension point, and g_io_extension_point_set_required_type() to
+ * set a required type.
+ *
+ * A module can implement an extension point by specifying the #GType
+ * that implements the functionality. Additionally, each implementation
+ * of an extension point has a name, and a priority. Use
+ * g_io_extension_point_implement() to implement an extension point.
+ *
+ *  |[<!-- language="C" -->
+ *  GIOExtensionPoint *ep;
+ *
+ *  // Register an extension point
+ *  ep = g_io_extension_point_register ("my-extension-point");

+ *  ]|

+ *                                  "my-example",
+ *                                  10);
+ *  ]|
+ *
+ *  It is up to the code that registered the extension point how
+ *  it uses the implementations that have been associated with it.
+ *  Depending on the use case, it may use all implementations, or
+ *  only the one with the highest priority, or pick a specific
+ *  one by name.
+ *
+ *  To avoid opening all modules just to find out what extension
+ *  points they implement, GIO makes use of a caching mechanism,
+ *  see [gio-querymodules][gio-querymodules].
+ *  You are expected to run this command after installing a
+ *  GIO module.
+ *
+ *  The `GIO_EXTRA_MODULES` environment variable can be used to
+ *  specify additional directories to automatically load modules
+ *  from. This environment variable has the same syntax as the
+ *  `PATH`. If two modules have the same base name in different
+ *  directories, then the latter one will be ignored. If additional
+ *  directories are specified GIO will load modules from the built-in
+ *  directory last.

+ * @title: GAction
+ * @short_description: An action interface
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * #GAction represents a single named action.
+ *
+ * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
+ * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
+ * emitted.  An activation has a #GVariant parameter (which may be
+ * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
+ * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
+ *
+ * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
+ * set with g_action_change_state().  This call takes a #GVariant.  The
+ * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
+ * (which is given at construction time).
+ *
+ * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
+ * range.
+ *
+ * #GAction is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
+ * described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
+ * #GSimpleAction.
+ *
+ * In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
+ * name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the
+ * optional state type and the state and emitting the appropriate
+ * signals when these change.  The implementor is responsible for filtering
+ * calls to g_action_activate() and g_action_change_state() for type
+ * safety and for the state being enabled.
+ *
+ * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #GAction is to put it

+ *
+ * #GActionGroup represents a group of actions. Actions can be used to
+ * expose functionality in a structured way, either from one part of a
+ * program to another, or to the outside world. Action groups are often
+ * used together with a #GMenuModel that provides additional
+ * representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in
+ * a menu.
+ *
+ * The main way to interact with the actions in a GActionGroup is to
+ * activate them with g_action_group_activate_action(). Activating an
+ * action may require a #GVariant parameter. The required type of the
+ * parameter can be inquired with g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type().
+ * Actions may be disabled, see g_action_group_get_action_enabled().
+ * Activating a disabled action has no effect.
+ *
+ * Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The
+ * current state of an action can be inquired with
+ * g_action_group_get_action_state(). Activating a stateful action may
+ * change its state, but it is also possible to set the state by calling
+ * g_action_group_change_action_state().
+ *
+ * As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
+ * option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
+ * this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
+ * action would toggle the state.
+ *
+ * Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
+ * method calls, except g_action_group_list_actions() take the name of
+ * an action as an argument.
+ *
+ * The #GActionGroup API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
+ * group.  The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
+ * forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
+ * with actions.  'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
+ * the action group implementation) are found on subclasses.  This is
+ * why you will find - for example - g_action_group_get_action_enabled()
+ * but not an equivalent set() call.
+ *
+ * Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
+ * on individual actions.
+ *
+ * Implementations of #GActionGroup should provide implementations for
+ * the virtual functions g_action_group_list_actions() and
+ * g_action_group_query_action().  The other virtual functions should
+ * not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with
+ * calls to g_action_group_query_action().

+ *
+ * #GAppInfo and #GAppLaunchContext are used for describing and launching
+ * applications installed on the system.
+ *
+ * As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
+ * (using g_file_get_path()) when using g_app_info_launch() even if
+ * the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
+ * for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
+ * %U` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
+ * `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
+ * only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
+ * compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
+ * is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
+ * Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
+ * path (in gvfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
+ * passed unmodified to the application.
+ *
+ * Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
+ * back to the GIO URI in the #GFile constructors (since gvfs
+ * implements the #GVfs extension point). As such, if the application
+ * needs to examine the URI, it needs to use g_file_get_uri() or
+ * similar on #GFile. In other words, an application cannot assume
+ * that the URI passed to e.g. g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() is
+ * equal to the result of g_file_get_uri(). The following snippet
+ * illustrates this:
+ *
+ * |[
+ * GFile *f;
+ * char *uri;
+ *
+ * file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);

+ *   {
+ *     // do something special with uri
+ *   }
+ * g_object_unref (file);

+ *
+ * This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
+ * `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
+ * application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
+ * for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
+ * Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have

+ *
+ * Call g_app_info_monitor_get() to get a #GAppInfoMonitor and connect

+ * is because monitoring the app info database for changes is expensive.
+ *
+ * The following functions will re-arm the #GAppInfoMonitor::changed signal so

+ *  - g_app_info_get_all_for_type()

+/**
+ * SECTION:gapplication
+ * @title: GApplication
+ * @short_description: Core application class
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
+ * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
+ * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
+ * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
+ * this class outside of a higher level framework.
+ *
+ * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
+ * a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
+ * be changed using g_application_hold() and g_application_release(). If
+ * it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
+ * #GtkApplication employ the use count to ensure that the application
+ * stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
+ *
+ * Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
+ * uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
+ * providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
+ * with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
+ * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
+ * desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
+ * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
+ * running program. The already running instance of the program is
+ * called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
+ * always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
+ * is used for communication.
+ *
+ * The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used
+ * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
+ * application is not expected to manually register itself and check
+ * if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
+ * #GApplication should do very little more than instantiating the
+ * application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
+ * calling g_application_run(). All checks for uniqueness are done
+ * internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
+ * startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
+ * is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
+ * instance and g_application_run() promptly returns. See the code
+ * examples below.
+ *
+ * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is the
+ * same as that of a
+ * [D-Bus well-known bus name](https://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-bus).
+ * Examples include: `com.example.MyApp`, `org.example.internal_apps.Calculator`,
+ * `org._7_zip.Archiver`.
+ * For details on valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
+ *
+ * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
+ * on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
+ * application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
+ * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
+ * object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
+ * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
+ * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
+ * (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
+ * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
+ * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
+ * g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
+ * g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if you want to register object paths.
+ *
+ * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap
+ * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
+ * g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking an action by calling
+ * g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it is always
+ * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
+ * the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
+ * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
+ * for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.
+ *
+ * Note: Due to the fact that actions are exported on the session bus,
+ * using `maybe` parameters is not supported, since D-Bus does not support
+ * `maybe` types.
+ *
+ * There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
+ *
+ * - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
+ *
+ * - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
+ *
+ * - by handling a command-line
+ *
+ * - via activating an action
+ *
+ * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
+ * initialization for all of these in a single place.
+ *
+ * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
+ * application, GApplication passes some ‘platform data’ from the
+ * launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
+ * #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
+ * data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual functions
+ * in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
+ * #GApplicationCommandLine objects, the platform data is
+ * directly available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
+ * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
+ * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
+ *
+ * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
+ * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
+ * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
+ * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
+ * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
+ * %G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set. #GApplication subclasses
+ * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
+ * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
+ * data in this way.
+ *
+ * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
+ * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()

+ * @title: GApplicationCommandLine
+ * @short_description: A command-line invocation of an application
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GApplication
+ *
+ * #GApplicationCommandLine represents a command-line invocation of
+ * an application.  It is created by #GApplication and emitted
+ * in the #GApplication::command-line signal and virtual function.
+ *
+ * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
+ * with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
+ * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
+ * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
+ * commandline to this process).
+ *
+ * The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the @argc and @argv
+ * parameters for use with the #GOptionContext command-line parsing API,
+ * with the g_application_command_line_get_arguments() function. See
+ * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
+ * for an example.
+ *
+ * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
+ * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
+ * lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
+ * of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
+ * dropped).
+ *
+ * The main use for #GApplicationCommandLine (and the
+ * #GApplication::command-line signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
+ * You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
+ * your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
+ * have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
+ * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
+ * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
+ * does not return until the editing is done.
+ *
+ * Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
+ * #GApplication::command-line handler. The launching instance exits
+ * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
+ * the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
+ * of the launching instance.

+ * @short_description: Asynchronous Function Results
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GTask
+ *
+ * Provides a base class for implementing asynchronous function results.
+ *
+ * Asynchronous operations are broken up into two separate operations
+ * which are chained together by a #GAsyncReadyCallback. To begin
+ * an asynchronous operation, provide a #GAsyncReadyCallback to the
+ * asynchronous function. This callback will be triggered when the
+ * operation has completed, and must be run in a later iteration of
+ * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
+ * from where the operation was initiated. It will be passed a
+ * #GAsyncResult instance filled with the details of the operation's
+ * success or failure, the object the asynchronous function was
+ * started for and any error codes returned. The asynchronous callback
+ * function is then expected to call the corresponding "_finish()"
+ * function, passing the object the function was called for, the
+ * #GAsyncResult instance, and (optionally) an @error to grab any
+ * error conditions that may have occurred.
+ *
+ * The "_finish()" function for an operation takes the generic result
+ * (of type #GAsyncResult) and returns the specific result that the
+ * operation in question yields (e.g. a #GFileEnumerator for a
+ * "enumerate children" operation). If the result or error status of the
+ * operation is not needed, there is no need to call the "_finish()"
+ * function; GIO will take care of cleaning up the result and error
+ * information after the #GAsyncReadyCallback returns. You can pass
+ * %NULL for the #GAsyncReadyCallback if you don't need to take any
+ * action at all after the operation completes. Applications may also
+ * take a reference to the #GAsyncResult and call "_finish()" later;
+ * however, the "_finish()" function may be called at most once.
+ *
+ * Example of a typical asynchronous operation flow:
+ * |[<!-- language="C" -->
+ * void _theoretical_frobnitz_async (Theoretical         *t,

+ * The callback for an asynchronous operation is called only once, and is
+ * always called, even in the case of a cancelled operation. On cancellation
+ * the result is a %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED error.
+ *
+ * ## I/O Priority # {#io-priority}
+ *
+ * Many I/O-related asynchronous operations have a priority parameter,
+ * which is used in certain cases to determine the order in which

+ * I/O scheduling. Priorities are integers, with lower numbers indicating

+ * multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
+ * assemble or disassemble a message.
+ *
+ * Each #GDatagramBased operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
+ * for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for

+ * will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
+ * timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
+ * %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would
+ * successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or
+ * g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use
+ * g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a #GMainContext to get
+ * callbacks when I/O is possible.
+ *
+ * When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
+ * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
+ * said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
+ * condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
+ * instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
+ * returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
+ *
+ * As with #GSocket, #GDatagramBaseds can be either connection oriented (for
+ * example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). #GDatagramBaseds must be
+ * datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
+ * establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
+ * before sending and receiving data through the #GDatagramBased API. For
+ * connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
+ * received in each I/O operation.
+ *
+ * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GDatagramBased is not inherently thread safe.
+ * To use a #GDatagramBased concurrently from multiple threads, you must
+ * implement your own locking.

+ *
+ * The #GDBusConnection type is used for D-Bus connections to remote
+ * peers such as a message buses. It is a low-level API that offers a
+ * lot of flexibility. For instance, it lets you establish a connection
+ * over any transport that can by represented as a #GIOStream.
+ *
+ * This class is rarely used directly in D-Bus clients. If you are writing
+ * a D-Bus client, it is often easier to use the g_bus_own_name(),
+ * g_bus_watch_name() or g_dbus_proxy_new_for_bus() APIs.
+ *
+ * As an exception to the usual GLib rule that a particular object must not
+ * be used by two threads at the same time, #GDBusConnection's methods may be
+ * called from any thread. This is so that g_bus_get() and g_bus_get_sync()
+ * can safely return the same #GDBusConnection when called from any thread.
+ *
+ * Most of the ways to obtain a #GDBusConnection automatically initialize it
+ * (i.e. connect to D-Bus): for instance, g_dbus_connection_new() and
+ * g_bus_get(), and the synchronous versions of those methods, give you an
+ * initialized connection. Language bindings for GIO should use
+ * g_initable_new() or g_async_initable_new_async(), which also initialize the
+ * connection.
+ *
+ * If you construct an uninitialized #GDBusConnection, such as via
+ * g_object_new(), you must initialize it via g_initable_init() or
+ * g_async_initable_init_async() before using its methods or properties.
+ * Calling methods or accessing properties on a #GDBusConnection that has not
+ * completed initialization successfully is considered to be invalid, and leads
+ * to undefined behaviour. In particular, if initialization fails with a
+ * #GError, the only valid thing you can do with that #GDBusConnection is to
+ * free it with g_object_unref().

+ * @short_description: Mapping D-Bus errors to and from GError
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * All facilities that return errors from remote methods (such as
+ * g_dbus_connection_call_sync()) use #GError to represent both D-Bus
+ * errors (e.g. errors returned from the other peer) and locally
+ * in-process generated errors.
+ *
+ * To check if a returned #GError is an error from a remote peer, use
+ * g_dbus_error_is_remote_error(). To get the actual D-Bus error name,
+ * use g_dbus_error_get_remote_error(). Before presenting an error,

+ *
+ * In addition, facilities used to return errors to a remote peer also
+ * use #GError. See g_dbus_method_invocation_return_error() for
+ * discussion about how the D-Bus error name is set.
+ *
+ * Applications can associate a #GError error domain with a set of D-Bus errors in order to
+ * automatically map from D-Bus errors to #GError and back. This
+ * is typically done in the function returning the #GQuark for the

+ * the #GDBusObjectManager::object-added and

+ * #GDBusObjectProxy objects returned by
+ * g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects().
+ *
+ * If the name for a #GDBusObjectManagerClient is not owned by anyone at
+ * object construction time, the default behavior is to request the
+ * message bus to launch an owner for the name. This behavior can be
+ * disabled using the %G_DBUS_OBJECT_MANAGER_CLIENT_FLAGS_DO_NOT_AUTO_START
+ * flag. It's also worth noting that this only works if the name of
+ * interest is activatable in the first place. E.g. in some cases it
+ * is not possible to launch an owner for the requested name. In this
+ * case, #GDBusObjectManagerClient object construction still succeeds but
+ * there will be no object proxies
+ * (e.g. g_dbus_object_manager_get_objects() returns the empty list) and
+ * the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner property is %NULL.
+ *
+ * The owner of the requested name can come and go (for example
+ * consider a system service being restarted) – #GDBusObjectManagerClient
+ * handles this case too; simply connect to the #GObject::notify
+ * signal to watch for changes on the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
+ * property. When the name owner vanishes, the behavior is that
+ * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is set to %NULL (this includes
+ * emission of the #GObject::notify signal) and then
+ * #GDBusObjectManager::object-removed signals are synthesized
+ * for all currently existing object proxies. Since
+ * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is %NULL when this happens, you can
+ * use this information to disambiguate a synthesized signal from a
+ * genuine signal caused by object removal on the remote
+ * #GDBusObjectManager. Similarly, when a new name owner appears,
+ * #GDBusObjectManager::object-added signals are synthesized
+ * while #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner is still %NULL. Only when all
+ * object proxies have been added, the #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner
+ * is set to the new name owner (this includes emission of the
+ * #GObject::notify signal).  Furthermore, you are guaranteed that
+ * #GDBusObjectManagerClient:name-owner will alternate between a name owner
+ * (e.g. `:1.42`) and %NULL even in the case where
+ * the name of interest is atomically replaced
+ *
+ * Ultimately, #GDBusObjectManagerClient is used to obtain #GDBusProxy
+ * instances. All signals (including the
+ * org.freedesktop.DBus.Properties::PropertiesChanged signal)
+ * delivered to #GDBusProxy instances are guaranteed to originate
+ * from the name owner. This guarantee along with the behavior
+ * described above, means that certain race conditions including the
+ * "half the proxy is from the old owner and the other half is from

+ * If the proxy is for a stateless D-Bus service, where the name owner may

+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GFileInfo, #GFileEnumerator
+ *
+ * #GFile is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a
+ * virtual file system. #GFiles are lightweight, immutable objects
+ * that do no I/O upon creation. It is necessary to understand that
+ * #GFile objects do not represent files, merely an identifier for a
+ * file. All file content I/O is implemented as streaming operations
+ * (see #GInputStream and #GOutputStream).
+ *
+ * To construct a #GFile, you can use:
+ * - g_file_new_for_path() if you have a path.
+ * - g_file_new_for_uri() if you have a URI.
+ * - g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() for a command line argument.
+ * - g_file_new_tmp() to create a temporary file from a template.
+ * - g_file_new_tmp_async() to asynchronously create a temporary file.
+ * - g_file_new_tmp_dir_async() to asynchronously create a temporary directory.
+ * - g_file_parse_name() from a UTF-8 string gotten from g_file_get_parse_name().
+ * - g_file_new_build_filename() or g_file_new_build_filenamev() to create a file from path elements.
+ *
+ * One way to think of a #GFile is as an abstraction of a pathname. For
+ * normal files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as
+ * #GFiles are extensible it could also be something else that corresponds
+ * to a pathname in a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
+ *
+ * #GFiles make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to
+ * the files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with
+ * #GFile using g_file_get_parent() to get an identifier for the parent
+ * directory, g_file_get_child() to get a child within a directory,
+ * g_file_resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two
+ * #GFiles. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not end up at
+ * the same root if you repeatedly call g_file_get_parent() on two different
+ * files.
+ *
+ * All #GFiles have a basename (get with g_file_get_basename()). These names
+ * are byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem
+ * (relative to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they
+ * have any particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If
+ * you want to use filenames in a user interface you should use the display
+ * name that you can get by requesting the
+ * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME attribute with g_file_query_info().
+ * This is guaranteed to be in UTF-8 and can be used in a user interface.
+ * But always store the real basename or the #GFile to use to actually
+ * access the file, because there is no way to go from a display name to
+ * the actual name.
+ *
+ * Using #GFile as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path
+ * in that there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance,
+ * hard or soft links may cause two different #GFiles to refer to the same
+ * file. Other possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems,
+ * short and long names on FAT/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to
+ * check if two #GFiles point to the same file you can query for the
+ * %G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE attribute. Note that #GFile does some trivial
+ * canonicalization of pathnames passed in, so that trivial differences in
+ * the path string used at creation (duplicated slashes, slash at end of
+ * path, "." or ".." path segments, etc) does not create different #GFiles.
+ *
+ * Many #GFile operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions
+ * to suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions
+ * simply have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous
+ * I/O functions call a #GAsyncReadyCallback which is then used to finalize
+ * the operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the
+ * function's matching _finish() operation.
+ *
+ * It is highly recommended to use asynchronous calls when running within a
+ * shared main loop, such as in the main thread of an application. This avoids
+ * I/O operations blocking other sources on the main loop from being dispatched.
+ * Synchronous I/O operations should be performed from worker threads. See the
+ * [introduction to asynchronous programming section][async-programming] for
+ * more.
+ *
+ * Some #GFile operations almost always take a noticeable amount of time, and
+ * so do not have synchronous analogs. Notable cases include:
+ * - g_file_mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file.
+ * - g_file_unmount_mountable_with_operation() to unmount a mountable file.
+ * - g_file_eject_mountable_with_operation() to eject a mountable file.
+ *
+ * ## Entity Tags # {#gfile-etag}
+ *
+ * One notable feature of #GFiles are entity tags, or "etags" for
+ * short. Entity tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the
+ * traditional mtime, and can be used to quickly determine if the file
+ * has been modified from the version on the file system. See the
+ * HTTP 1.1
+ * [specification](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html)
+ * for HTTP Etag headers, which are a very similar concept.

+ *
+ * Information is stored within the list in #GFileAttributeInfo structures.

+ * attribute key will be registered for the user id for a given file).
+ *
+ * ## Default Namespaces
+ *
+ * - `"standard"`: The "Standard" namespace. General file information that
+ *   any application may need should be put in this namespace. Examples
+ *   include the file's name, type, and size.
+ * - `"etag`: The [Entity Tag][gfile-etag] namespace. Currently, the only key
+ *   in this namespace is "value", which contains the value of the current
+ *   entity tag.
+ * - `"id"`: The "Identification" namespace. This namespace is used by file
+ *   managers and applications that list directories to check for loops and
+ *   to uniquely identify files.
+ * - `"access"`: The "Access" namespace. Used to check if a user has the
+ *   proper privileges to access files and perform file operations. Keys in
+ *   this namespace are made to be generic and easily understood, e.g. the
+ *   "can_read" key is %TRUE if the current user has permission to read the
+ *   file. UNIX permissions and NTFS ACLs in Windows should be mapped to
+ *   these values.
+ * - `"mountable"`: The "Mountable" namespace. Includes simple boolean keys
+ *   for checking if a file or path supports mount operations, e.g. mount,
+ *   unmount, eject. These are used for files of type %G_FILE_TYPE_MOUNTABLE.
+ * - `"time"`: The "Time" namespace. Includes file access, changed, created
+ *   times.
+ * - `"unix"`: The "Unix" namespace. Includes UNIX-specific information and
+ *   may not be available for all files. Examples include the UNIX "UID",
+ *   "GID", etc.
+ * - `"dos"`: The "DOS" namespace. Includes DOS-specific information and may
+ *   not be available for all files. Examples include "is_system" for checking
+ *   if a file is marked as a system file, and "is_archive" for checking if a
+ *   file is marked as an archive file.
+ * - `"owner"`: The "Owner" namespace. Includes information about who owns a
+ *   file. May not be available for all file systems. Examples include "user"
+ *   for getting the user name of the file owner. This information is often
+ *   mapped from some backend specific data such as a UNIX UID.
+ * - `"thumbnail"`: The "Thumbnail" namespace. Includes information about file
+ *   thumbnails and their location within the file system. Examples of keys in
+ *   this namespace include "path" to get the location of a thumbnail, "failed"
+ *   to check if thumbnailing of the file failed, and "is-valid" to check if
+ *   the thumbnail is outdated.
+ * - `"filesystem"`: The "Filesystem" namespace. Gets information about the
+ *   file system where a file is located, such as its type, how much space is
+ *   left available, and the overall size of the file system.
+ * - `"gvfs"`: The "GVFS" namespace. Keys in this namespace contain information
+ *   about the current GVFS backend in use.
+ * - `"xattr"`: The "xattr" namespace. Gets information about extended
+ *   user attributes. See attr(5). The "user." prefix of the extended user
+ *   attribute name is stripped away when constructing keys in this namespace,
+ *   e.g. "xattr::mime_type" for the extended attribute with the name
+ *   "user.mime_type". Note that this information is only available if
+ *   GLib has been built with extended attribute support.
+ * - `"xattr-sys"`: The "xattr-sys" namespace. Gets information about
+ *   extended attributes which are not user-specific. See attr(5). Note
+ *   that this information is only available if GLib has been built with
+ *   extended attribute support.
+ * - `"selinux"`: The "SELinux" namespace. Includes information about the
+ *   SELinux context of files. Note that this information is only available
+ *   if GLib has been built with SELinux support.
+ *
+ * Please note that these are not all of the possible namespaces.
+ * More namespaces can be added from GIO modules or by individual applications.
+ * For more information about writing GIO modules, see #GIOModule.

+ * file systems -->
+ *
+ * ## Default Keys
+ *
+ * For a list of the built-in keys and their types, see the
+ * [GFileInfo][GFileInfo] documentation.
+ *
+ * Note that there are no predefined keys in the "xattr" and "xattr-sys"
+ * namespaces. Keys for the "xattr" namespace are constructed by stripping
+ * away the "user." prefix from the extended user attribute, and prepending
+ * "xattr::". Keys for the "xattr-sys" namespace are constructed by
+ * concatenating "xattr-sys::" with the extended attribute name. All extended
+ * attribute values are returned as hex-encoded strings in which bytes outside
+ * the ASCII range are encoded as escape sequences of the form \x`nn`
+ * where `nn` is a 2-digit hexadecimal number.

+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GInputStream, #GOutputStream
+ *
+ * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
+ * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
+ * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
+ * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
+ *
+ * Examples of #GIOStream objects are #GSocketConnection, which represents
+ * a two-way network connection; and #GFileIOStream, which represents a
+ * file handle opened in read-write mode.
+ *
+ * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
+ * with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
+ *
+ * The #GIOStream object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
+ * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the #GIOStream
+ * object alive. If the #GIOStream object is freed it will be closed, thus
+ * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
+ * always return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
+ *
+ * To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
+ * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
+ * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
+ * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
+ * #GIOStream may still be open. However, some streams may support
+ * "half-closed" states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
+ *
+ * Operations on #GIOStreams cannot be started while another operation on the
+ * #GIOStream or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
+ * read from the #GInputStream and write to the #GOutputStream simultaneously
+ * (either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
+ * thread), but an application cannot start any #GIOStream operation while there
+ * is a #GIOStream, #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation in progress, and
+ * an application can’t start any #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation
+ * while there is a #GIOStream operation in progress.
+ *
+ * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
+ * given #GMainContext (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
+ * started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
+ * #GMainContext.
+ *
+ * GIO may run operations on #GIOStreams from other (worker) threads, and this
+ * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
+ * as #GBufferedInputStream or #GTlsConnection. With such wrapper APIs,
+ * application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
+ * the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
+ * not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
+ * stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).

+ *
+ * #GListModel is an interface that represents a mutable list of
+ * #GObjects. Its main intention is as a model for various widgets in
+ * user interfaces, such as list views, but it can also be used as a
+ * convenient method of returning lists of data, with support for
+ * updates.
+ *
+ * Each object in the list may also report changes in itself via some
+ * mechanism (normally the #GObject::notify signal).  Taken together
+ * with the #GListModel::items-changed signal, this provides for a list
+ * that can change its membership, and in which the members can change
+ * their individual properties.
+ *
+ * A good example would be the list of visible wireless network access
+ * points, where each access point can report dynamic properties such as
+ * signal strength.
+ *
+ * It is important to note that the #GListModel itself does not report
+ * changes to the individual items.  It only reports changes to the list
+ * membership.  If you want to observe changes to the objects themselves
+ * then you need to connect signals to the objects that you are
+ * interested in.
+ *
+ * All items in a #GListModel are of (or derived from) the same type.
+ * g_list_model_get_item_type() returns that type.  The type may be an
+ * interface, in which case all objects in the list must implement it.
+ *
+ * The semantics are close to that of an array:
+ * g_list_model_get_n_items() returns the number of items in the list and
+ * g_list_model_get_item() returns an item at a (0-based) position. In
+ * order to allow implementations to calculate the list length lazily,
+ * you can also iterate over items: starting from 0, repeatedly call
+ * g_list_model_get_item() until it returns %NULL.
+ *
+ * An implementation may create objects lazily, but must take care to
+ * return the same object for a given position until all references to
+ * it are gone.
+ *
+ * On the other side, a consumer is expected only to hold references on
+ * objects that are currently "user visible", in order to facilitate the
+ * maximum level of laziness in the implementation of the list and to
+ * reduce the required number of signal connections at a given time.
+ *
+ * This interface is intended only to be used from a single thread.  The
+ * thread in which it is appropriate to use it depends on the particular
+ * implementation, but typically it will be from the thread that owns
+ * the [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
+ * in effect at the time that the model was created.
+ *
+ * Over time, it has established itself as good practice for listmodel
+ * implementations to provide properties `item-type` and `n-items` to
+ * ease working with them. While it is not required, it is recommended
+ * that implementations provide these two properties. They should return

+ * in which it is used).
+ *
+ * As an example, consider the visible portions of this menu:
+ *
+ * ## An example menu # {#menu-example}
+ *
+ * ![](menu-example.png)
+ *
+ * There are 8 "menus" visible in the screenshot: one menubar, two
+ * submenus and 5 sections:
+ *
+ * - the toplevel menubar (containing 4 items)
+ * - the View submenu (containing 3 sections)
+ * - the first section of the View submenu (containing 2 items)
+ * - the second section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
+ * - the final section of the View submenu (containing 1 item)
+ * - the Highlight Mode submenu (containing 2 sections)
+ * - the Sources section (containing 2 items)
+ * - the Markup section (containing 2 items)
+ *
+ * The [example][menu-model] illustrates the conceptual connection between
+ * these 8 menus. Each large block in the figure represents a menu and the
+ * smaller blocks within the large block represent items in that menu. Some
+ * items contain references to other menus.
+ *
+ * ## A menu example # {#menu-model}
+ *
+ * ![](menu-model.png)
+ *
+ * Notice that the separators visible in the [example][menu-example]
+ * appear nowhere in the [menu model][menu-model]. This is because
+ * separators are not explicitly represented in the menu model. Instead,
+ * a separator is inserted between any two non-empty sections of a menu.
+ * Section items can have labels just like any other item. In that case,
+ * a display system may show a section header instead of a separator.
+ *
+ * The motivation for this abstract model of application controls is
+ * that modern user interfaces tend to make these controls available
+ * outside the application. Examples include global menus, jumplists,
+ * dash boards, etc. To support such uses, it is necessary to 'export'
+ * information about actions and their representation in menus, which
+ * is exactly what the [GActionGroup exporter][gio-GActionGroup-exporter]
+ * and the [GMenuModel exporter][gio-GMenuModel-exporter] do for
+ * #GActionGroup and #GMenuModel. The client-side counterparts to
+ * make use of the exported information are #GDBusActionGroup and
+ * #GDBusMenuModel.
+ *
+ * The API of #GMenuModel is very generic, with iterators for the
+ * attributes and links of an item, see g_menu_model_iterate_item_attributes()
+ * and g_menu_model_iterate_item_links(). The 'standard' attributes and
+ * link types have predefined names: %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_LABEL,
+ * %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION, %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_TARGET, %G_MENU_LINK_SECTION
+ * and %G_MENU_LINK_SUBMENU.
+ *
+ * Items in a #GMenuModel represent active controls if they refer to
+ * an action that can get activated when the user interacts with the
+ * menu item. The reference to the action is encoded by the string id
+ * in the %G_MENU_ATTRIBUTE_ACTION attribute. An action id uniquely
+ * identifies an action in an action group. Which action group(s) provide
+ * actions depends on the context in which the menu model is used.
+ * E.g. when the model is exported as the application menu of a
+ * #GtkApplication, actions can be application-wide or window-specific
+ * (and thus come from two different action groups). By convention, the
+ * application-wide actions have names that start with "app.", while the
+ * names of window-specific actions start with "win.".
+ *
+ * While a wide variety of stateful actions is possible, the following
+ * is the minimum that is expected to be supported by all users of exported
+ * menu information:
+ * - an action with no parameter type and no state
+ * - an action with no parameter type and boolean state
+ * - an action with string parameter type and string state
+ *
+ * ## Stateless
+ *
+ * A stateless action typically corresponds to an ordinary menu item.
+ *
+ * Selecting such a menu item will activate the action (with no parameter).
+ *
+ * ## Boolean State
+ *
+ * An action with a boolean state will most typically be used with a "toggle"
+ * or "switch" menu item. The state can be set directly, but activating the
+ * action (with no parameter) results in the state being toggled.
+ *
+ * Selecting a toggle menu item will activate the action. The menu item should
+ * be rendered as "checked" when the state is true.
+ *
+ * ## String Parameter and State
+ *
+ * Actions with string parameters and state will most typically be used to
+ * represent an enumerated choice over the items available for a group of
+ * radio menu items. Activating the action with a string parameter is
+ * equivalent to setting that parameter as the state.
+ *
+ * Radio menu items, in addition to being associated with the action, will
+ * have a target value. Selecting that menu item will result in activation
+ * of the action with the target value as the parameter. The menu item should
+ * be rendered as "selected" when the state of the action is equal to the
+ * target value of the menu item.

+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * A #GPropertyAction is a way to get a #GAction with a state value
+ * reflecting and controlling the value of a #GObject property.
+ *
+ * The state of the action will correspond to the value of the property.
+ * Changing it will change the property (assuming the requested value
+ * matches the requirements as specified in the #GParamSpec).
+ *
+ * Only the most common types are presently supported.  Booleans are
+ * mapped to booleans, strings to strings, signed/unsigned integers to
+ * int32/uint32 and floats and doubles to doubles.
+ *
+ * If the property is an enum then the state will be string-typed and
+ * conversion will automatically be performed between the enum value and
+ * "nick" string as per the #GEnumValue table.
+ *
+ * Flags types are not currently supported.
+ *
+ * Properties of object types, boxed types and pointer types are not
+ * supported and probably never will be.
+ *
+ * Properties of #GVariant types are not currently supported.
+ *
+ * If the property is boolean-valued then the action will have a NULL
+ * parameter type, and activating the action (with no parameter) will
+ * toggle the value of the property.
+ *
+ * In all other cases, the parameter type will correspond to the type of
+ * the property.
+ *
+ * The general idea here is to reduce the number of locations where a
+ * particular piece of state is kept (and therefore has to be synchronised
+ * between). #GPropertyAction does not have a separate state that is kept
+ * in sync with the property value -- its state is the property value.
+ *
+ * For example, it might be useful to create a #GAction corresponding to
+ * the "visible-child-name" property of a #GtkStack so that the current
+ * page can be switched from a menu.  The active radio indication in the
+ * menu is then directly determined from the active page of the
+ * #GtkStack.
+ *
+ * An anti-example would be binding the "active-id" property on a
+ * #GtkComboBox.  This is because the state of the combobox itself is
+ * probably uninteresting and is actually being used to control
+ * something else.
+ *
+ * Another anti-example would be to bind to the "visible-child-name"
+ * property of a #GtkStack if this value is actually stored in
+ * #GSettings.  In that case, the real source of the value is
+ * #GSettings.  If you want a #GAction to control a setting stored in
+ * #GSettings, see g_settings_create_action() instead, and possibly

+ *
+ * The #GResource API and the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
+ * provide a convenient and efficient alternative to this which has some nice properties. You
+ * maintain the files as normal files, so its easy to edit them, but during the build the files
+ * are combined into a binary bundle that is linked into the executable. This means that loading
+ * the resource files are efficient (as they are already in memory, shared with other instances) and
+ * simple (no need to check for things like I/O errors or locate the files in the filesystem). It
+ * also makes it easier to create relocatable applications.
+ *
+ * Resource files can also be marked as compressed. Such files will be included in the resource bundle
+ * in a compressed form, but will be automatically uncompressed when the resource is used. This
+ * is very useful e.g. for larger text files that are parsed once (or rarely) and then thrown away.
+ *
+ * Resource files can also be marked to be preprocessed, by setting the value of the
+ * `preprocess` attribute to a comma-separated list of preprocessing options.
+ * The only options currently supported are:
+ *
+ * `xml-stripblanks` which will use the xmllint command
+ * to strip ignorable whitespace from the XML file. For this to work,
+ * the `XMLLINT` environment variable must be set to the full path to
+ * the xmllint executable, or xmllint must be in the `PATH`; otherwise
+ * the preprocessing step is skipped.
+ *
+ * `to-pixdata` (deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32) which will use the
+ * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` command to convert images to the #GdkPixdata format,
+ * which allows you to create pixbufs directly using the data inside the
+ * resource file, rather than an (uncompressed) copy of it. For this, the
+ * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` program must be in the `PATH`, or the
+ * `GDK_PIXBUF_PIXDATA` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
+ * `gdk-pixbuf-pixdata` executable; otherwise the resource compiler will abort.
+ * `to-pixdata` has been deprecated since gdk-pixbuf 2.32, as #GResource
+ * supports embedding modern image formats just as well. Instead of using it,
+ * embed a PNG or SVG file in your #GResource.
+ *
+ * `json-stripblanks` which will use the `json-glib-format` command to strip
+ * ignorable whitespace from the JSON file. For this to work, the
+ * `JSON_GLIB_FORMAT` environment variable must be set to the full path to the
+ * `json-glib-format` executable, or it must be in the `PATH`;
+ * otherwise the preprocessing step is skipped. In addition, at least version
+ * 1.6 of `json-glib-format` is required.
+ *
+ * Resource files will be exported in the GResource namespace using the
+ * combination of the given `prefix` and the filename from the `file` element.
+ * The `alias` attribute can be used to alter the filename to expose them at a
+ * different location in the resource namespace. Typically, this is used to
+ * include files from a different source directory without exposing the source
+ * directory in the resource namespace, as in the example below.
+ *
+ * Resource bundles are created by the [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] program
+ * which takes an XML file that describes the bundle, and a set of files that the XML references. These
+ * are combined into a binary resource bundle.

+ * <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
+ * <gresources>
+ *   <gresource prefix="/org/gtk/Example">
+ *     <file>data/splashscreen.png</file>
+ *     <file compressed="true">dialog.ui</file>
+ *     <file preprocess="xml-stripblanks">menumarkup.xml</file>
+ *     <file alias="example.css">data/example.css</file>
+ *   </gresource>
+ * </gresources>
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * This will create a resource bundle with the following files:
+ * |[
+ * /org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png
+ * /org/gtk/Example/dialog.ui
+ * /org/gtk/Example/menumarkup.xml
+ * /org/gtk/Example/example.css
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * Note that all resources in the process share the same namespace, so use Java-style
+ * path prefixes (like in the above example) to avoid conflicts.
+ *
+ * You can then use [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources] to compile the XML to a
+ * binary bundle that you can load with g_resource_load(). However, its more common to use the --generate-source and
+ * --generate-header arguments to create a source file and header to link directly into your application.
+ * This will generate `get_resource()`, `register_resource()` and
+ * `unregister_resource()` functions, prefixed by the `--c-name` argument passed
+ * to [glib-compile-resources][glib-compile-resources]. `get_resource()` returns
+ * the generated #GResource object. The register and unregister functions
+ * register the resource so its files can be accessed using
+ * g_resources_lookup_data().
+ *
+ * Once a #GResource has been created and registered all the data in it can be accessed globally in the process by
+ * using API calls like g_resources_open_stream() to stream the data or g_resources_lookup_data() to get a direct pointer
+ * to the data. You can also use URIs like "resource:///org/gtk/Example/data/splashscreen.png" with #GFile to access
+ * the resource data.
+ *
+ * Some higher-level APIs, such as #GtkApplication, will automatically load
+ * resources from certain well-known paths in the resource namespace as a
+ * convenience. See the documentation for those APIs for details.
+ *
+ * There are two forms of the generated source, the default version uses the compiler support for constructor
+ * and destructor functions (where available) to automatically create and register the #GResource on startup
+ * or library load time. If you pass `--manual-register`, two functions to register/unregister the resource are created
+ * instead. This requires an explicit initialization call in your application/library, but it works on all platforms,
+ * even on the minor ones where constructors are not supported. (Constructor support is available for at least Win32, Mac OS and Linux.)
+ *
+ * Note that resource data can point directly into the data segment of e.g. a library, so if you are unloading libraries
+ * during runtime you need to be very careful with keeping around pointers to data from a resource, as this goes away
+ * when the library is unloaded. However, in practice this is not generally a problem, since most resource accesses
+ * are for your own resources, and resource data is often used once, during parsing, and then released.
+ *
+ * When debugging a program or testing a change to an installed version, it is often useful to be able to
+ * replace resources in the program or library, without recompiling, for debugging or quick hacking and testing
+ * purposes. Since GLib 2.50, it is possible to use the `G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS` environment variable to selectively overlay
+ * resources with replacements from the filesystem.  It is a %G_SEARCHPATH_SEPARATOR-separated list of substitutions to perform
+ * during resource lookups. It is ignored when running in a setuid process.
+ *
+ * A substitution has the form
+ *
+ * |[
+ *    /org/gtk/libgtk=/home/desrt/gtk-overlay
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * The part before the `=` is the resource subpath for which the overlay applies.  The part after is a
+ * filesystem path which contains files and subdirectories as you would like to be loaded as resources with the
+ * equivalent names.
+ *
+ * In the example above, if an application tried to load a resource with the resource path
+ * `/org/gtk/libgtk/ui/gtkdialog.ui` then GResource would check the filesystem path
+ * `/home/desrt/gtk-overlay/ui/gtkdialog.ui`.  If a file was found there, it would be used instead.  This is an
+ * overlay, not an outright replacement, which means that if a file is not found at that path, the built-in
+ * version will be used instead.  Whiteouts are not currently supported.
+ *
+ * Substitutions must start with a slash, and must not contain a trailing slash before the '='.  The path after
+ * the slash should ideally be absolute, but this is not strictly required.  It is possible to overlay the
+ * location of a single resource with an individual file.
+ *

+/**
+ * SECTION:gsettings
+ * @short_description: High-level API for application settings
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * The #GSettings class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
+ * application settings.
+ *
+ * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
+ * settings with #GSettings is typically extremely fast: on
+ * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
+ * #GHashTable lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
+ * of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
+ * for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
+ * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
+ * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
+ * a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
+ * even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
+ * only ever modify #GSettings keys in response to explicit user action.
+ * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
+ * made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
+ * of preferences widgets.  The built-in g_settings_bind() functionality
+ * is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
+ * result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
+ *
+ * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
+ * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
+ * values, as well as some other information.
+ *
+ * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
+ * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
+ * can also be '[relocatable][gsettings-relocatable]', i.e. not equipped with
+ * a fixed path. This is
+ * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
+ * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
+ *
+ * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
+ * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
+ * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
+ * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
+ * "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
+ * Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
+ * they often did in GConf.
+ *
+ * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
+ * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
+ * values as #GVariant, and allows any #GVariantType for keys. Key names
+ * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
+ * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
+ * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
+ *
+ * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
+ * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
+ * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
+ * `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
+ * elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
+ * the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
+ * the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
+ *
+ * The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
+ * [locale category for
+ * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
+ * The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
+ * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
+ * XML comment immediately above the <default> element — it is recommended to
+ * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
+ * implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
+ * attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
+ * defaults which use the same string.
+ *
+ * For example:
+ * |[
+ *  <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
+ *       GVariant serialization syntax.
+ *       See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
+ *  <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
+ * #GVariants (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
+ * errors will occur.
+ *
+ * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
+ * by the [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas]
+ * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
+ *
+ * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
+ * [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
+ *
+ * The [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] tool expects schema
+ * files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
+ *
+ * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
+ * id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
+ * ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
+ * e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
+ * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
+ * and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
+ * associated with one named application, the id should not use
+ * StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
+ *
+ * In addition to #GVariant types, keys can have types that have
+ * enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
+ * <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
+ * [example][schema-enumerated]. The underlying type of such a key
+ * is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(), g_settings_set_enum(),
+ * g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags() access the numeric values
+ * corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
+ *
+ * An example for default value:
+ * |[
+ * <schemalist>
+ *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
+ *
+ *     <key name="greeting" type="s">
+ *       <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
+ *       <summary>A greeting</summary>
+ *       <description>
+ *         Greeting of the invading martians
+ *       </description>
+ *     </key>
+ *
+ *     <key name="box" type="(ii)">
+ *       <default>(20,30)</default>
+ *     </key>
+ *
+ *     <key name="empty-string" type="s">
+ *       <default>""</default>
+ *       <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
+ *     </key>
+ *
+ *   </schema>
+ * </schemalist>
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
+ * |[
+ * <schemalist>
+ *
+ *   <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
+ *     <value nick="first" value="1"/>
+ *     <value nick="second" value="2"/>

+ *   <schema id="org.gtk.Test">

+ *     <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
+ *       <range min="1" max="100"/>
+ *       <default>10</default>
+ *     </key>
+ *
+ *     <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
+ *       <choices>
+ *         <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
+ *         <choice value='Annabeth'/>
+ *         <choice value='Joe'/>
+ *       </choices>
+ *       <aliases>
+ *         <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>

+ *

+ *       <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
+ *     </key>
+ *   </schema>
+ * </schemalist>
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * ## Vendor overrides
+ *
+ * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
+ * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
+ * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
+ * is inconvenient and error-prone,
+ * [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] reads so-called vendor
+ * override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
+ * schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
+ * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
+ * serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
+ * |[
+ *     [org.gtk.Example]
+ *     key1='string'
+ *     key2=1.5
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
+ * `.gschema.override`.
+ *
+ * ## Binding
+ *
+ * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind #GObject properties
+ * directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
+ * has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
+ * propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
+ * between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
+ *
+ * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
+ * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
+ * looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
+ * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
+ * If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
+ * %G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY flag.
+ *
+ * ## Relocatable schemas # {#gsettings-relocatable}
+ *
+ * A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
+ * <schema> element. By using g_settings_new_with_path(), a #GSettings object
+ * can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
+ * instance. Paths passed to g_settings_new_with_path() will typically be
+ * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
+ * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
+ * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
+ * dependency library.
+ *
+ * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
+ * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
+ * `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
+ * `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
+ * `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
+ * they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
+ * |[
+ * <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
+ *   <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
+ * </schema>
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * ## Build system integration # {#gsettings-build-system}
+ *
+ * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
+ * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
+ * following to your `configure.ac`:
+ * |[
+ * GLIB_GSETTINGS
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
+ * install the named schema:
+ * |[
+ * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
+ * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
+ *
+ * @GSETTINGS_RULES@
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
+ * translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
+ * be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
+ * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
+ * |[
+ * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
+ * |[
+ * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
+ * <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
+ * attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
+ * by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
+ * `.gschema.xml.in` template.
+ *
+ * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
+ * schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
+ * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
+ * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
+ * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
+ * |[
+ * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
+ * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
+ * which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
+ * `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
+ * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
+ * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
+ * `EXTRA_DIST`.

+/**
+ * SECTION:gsettingsschema
+ * @short_description: Introspecting and controlling the loading
+ *     of GSettings schemas
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * The #GSettingsSchemaSource and #GSettingsSchema APIs provide a
+ * mechanism for advanced control over the loading of schemas and a
+ * mechanism for introspecting their content.
+ *
+ * Plugin loading systems that wish to provide plugins a way to access
+ * settings face the problem of how to make the schemas for these
+ * settings visible to GSettings.  Typically, a plugin will want to ship
+ * the schema along with itself and it won't be installed into the
+ * standard system directories for schemas.
+ *
+ * #GSettingsSchemaSource provides a mechanism for dealing with this by
+ * allowing the creation of a new 'schema source' from which schemas can
+ * be acquired.  This schema source can then become part of the metadata
+ * associated with the plugin and queried whenever the plugin requires
+ * access to some settings.
+ *
+ * Consider the following example:
+ *
+ * |[<!-- language="C" -->
+ * typedef struct
+ * {
+ *    ...
+ *    GSettingsSchemaSource *schema_source;
+ *    ...
+ * } Plugin;
+ *
+ * Plugin *
+ * initialise_plugin (const gchar *dir)
+ * {
+ *   Plugin *plugin;
+ *
+ *   ...
+ *
+ *   plugin->schema_source =
+ *     g_settings_schema_source_new_from_directory (dir,
+ *       g_settings_schema_source_get_default (), FALSE, NULL);
+ *
+ *   ...
+ *
+ *   return plugin;
+ * }
+ *
+ * ...
+ *
+ * GSettings *
+ * plugin_get_settings (Plugin      *plugin,
+ *                      const gchar *schema_id)
+ * {
+ *   GSettingsSchema *schema;
+ *
+ *   if (schema_id == NULL)
+ *     schema_id = plugin->identifier;
+ *
+ *   schema = g_settings_schema_source_lookup (plugin->schema_source,
+ *                                             schema_id, FALSE);
+ *
+ *   if (schema == NULL)
+ *     {
+ *       ... disable the plugin or abort, etc ...
+ *     }
+ *
+ *   return g_settings_new_full (schema, NULL, NULL);
+ * }
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * The code above shows how hooks should be added to the code that
+ * initialises (or enables) the plugin to create the schema source and
+ * how an API can be added to the plugin system to provide a convenient
+ * way for the plugin to access its settings, using the schemas that it
+ * ships.
+ *
+ * From the standpoint of the plugin, it would need to ensure that it
+ * ships a gschemas.compiled file as part of itself, and then simply do
+ * the following:
+ *
+ * |[<!-- language="C" -->
+ * {
+ *   GSettings *settings;
+ *   gint some_value;
+ *
+ *   settings = plugin_get_settings (self, NULL);
+ *   some_value = g_settings_get_int (settings, "some-value");
+ *   ...
+ * }
+ * ]|
+ *
+ * It's also possible that the plugin system expects the schema source
+ * files (ie: .gschema.xml files) instead of a gschemas.compiled file.
+ * In that case, the plugin loading system must compile the schemas for
+ * itself before attempting to create the settings source.

+ * #GTask, which provides a simpler API.

+ * #GSimpleAsyncResult implements #GAsyncResult.
+ *
+ * GSimpleAsyncResult handles #GAsyncReadyCallbacks, error

+ * @short_description: Low-level socket object
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GInitable, [<gnetworking.h>][gio-gnetworking.h]
+ *
+ * A #GSocket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
+ * direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
+ * It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
+ *
+ * #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
+ * network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
+ * use it directly, but rather through classes like #GSocketClient,
+ * #GSocketService and #GSocketConnection. However there may be cases where
+ * direct use of #GSocket is useful.
+ *
+ * #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually constructed
+ * by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check the
+ * results before using the object. This is done automatically in
+ * g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
+ * %NULL.
+ *
+ * Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
+ * in blocking mode all operations (which don’t take an explicit blocking
+ * parameter) block until the requested operation
+ * is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
+ * would block return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error.
+ * To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_socket_condition_check(),
+ * or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
+ * attach it to a #GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
+ * Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
+ * blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
+ *
+ * When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
+ * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
+ * function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
+ * of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
+ * reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
+ * until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
+ *
+ * #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
+ * For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
+ * either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
+ * address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
+ * specified or received in each I/O operation.
+ *
+ * All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
+ *
+ * Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
+ * ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
+ * command-line utility that uses #GSocket, you may need to take into
+ * account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
+ * if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
+ *
+ * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
+ * a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
+ * locking.

+ * Processes can be communicated with using standard GIO-style APIs (ie:

+ *
+ * There is an API to force a process to terminate, as well as a

+ *
+ * One major advantage that GIO brings over the core GLib library is
+ * comprehensive API for asynchronous I/O, such
+ * g_output_stream_splice_async().  This makes GSubprocess
+ * significantly more powerful and flexible than equivalent APIs in
+ * some other languages such as the `subprocess.py`

+ * #GSubprocess will quickly reap all child processes as they exit,
+ * avoiding "zombie processes" remaining around for long periods of
+ * time.  g_subprocess_wait() can be used to wait for this to happen,
+ * but it will happen even without the call being explicitly made.
+ *
+ * As a matter of principle, #GSubprocess has no API that accepts
+ * shell-style space-separated strings.  It will, however, match the
+ * typical shell behaviour of searching the PATH for executables that do
+ * not contain a directory separator in their name. By default, the `PATH`
+ * of the current process is used.  You can specify
+ * %G_SUBPROCESS_FLAGS_SEARCH_PATH_FROM_ENVP to use the `PATH` of the
+ * launcher environment instead.
+ *
+ * #GSubprocess attempts to have a very simple API for most uses (ie:
+ * spawning a subprocess with arguments and support for most typical
+ * kinds of input and output redirection).  See g_subprocess_new(). The
+ * #GSubprocessLauncher API is provided for more complicated cases
+ * (advanced types of redirection, environment variable manipulation,
+ * change of working directory, child setup functions, etc).
+ *
+ * A typical use of #GSubprocess will involve calling
+ * g_subprocess_new(), followed by g_subprocess_wait_async() or
+ * g_subprocess_wait().  After the process exits, the status can be
+ * checked using functions such as g_subprocess_get_if_exited() (which
+ * are similar to the familiar WIFEXITED-style POSIX macros).

+ * @short_description: Cancellable synchronous or asynchronous task
+ *     and result
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ * @see_also: #GAsyncResult
+ *
+ * A #GTask represents and manages a cancellable "task".
+ *
+ * ## Asynchronous operations
+ *
+ * The most common usage of #GTask is as a #GAsyncResult, to
+ * manage data during an asynchronous operation. You call
+ * g_task_new() in the "start" method, followed by
+ * g_task_set_task_data() and the like if you need to keep some
+ * additional data associated with the task, and then pass the
+ * task object around through your asynchronous operation.
+ * Eventually, you will call a method such as
+ * g_task_return_pointer() or g_task_return_error(), which will
+ * save the value you give it and then invoke the task's callback
+ * function in the
+ * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
+ * where it was created (waiting until the next iteration of the main
+ * loop first, if necessary). The caller will pass the #GTask back to
+ * the operation's finish function (as a #GAsyncResult), and you can
+ * use g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like to extract the
+ * return value.
+ *
+ * Using #GTask requires the thread-default #GMainContext from when the
+ * #GTask was constructed to be running at least until the task has completed
+ * and its data has been freed.
+ *
+ * If a #GTask has been constructed and its callback set, it is an error to
+ * not call `g_task_return_*()` on it. GLib will warn at runtime if this happens
+ * (since 2.76).
+ *
+ * Here is an example for using GTask as a GAsyncResult:

+ * ## Chained asynchronous operations
+ *
+ * #GTask also tries to simplify asynchronous operations that

+ * and g_task_get_priority() allow you to get back the task's
+ * #GCancellable, #GMainContext, and [I/O priority][io-priority]
+ * when starting a new subtask, so you don't have to keep track
+ * of them yourself. g_task_attach_source() simplifies the case

+ * #GMainContext and priority).

+ *
+ * ## Porting from GSimpleAsyncResult
+ *
+ * #GTask's API attempts to be simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult's
+ * in several ways:
+ * - You can save task-specific data with g_task_set_task_data(), and
+ *   retrieve it later with g_task_get_task_data(). This replaces the
+ *   abuse of g_simple_async_result_set_op_res_gpointer() for the same
+ *   purpose with #GSimpleAsyncResult.
+ * - In addition to the task data, #GTask also keeps track of the
+ *   [priority][io-priority], #GCancellable, and
+ *   #GMainContext associated with the task, so tasks that consist of
+ *   a chain of simpler asynchronous operations will have easy access
+ *   to those values when starting each sub-task.
+ * - g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() provides simplified
+ *   handling for cancellation. In addition, cancellation
+ *   overrides any other #GTask return value by default, like
+ *   #GSimpleAsyncResult does when
+ *   g_simple_async_result_set_check_cancellable() is called.
+ *   (You can use g_task_set_check_cancellable() to turn off that
+ *   behavior.) On the other hand, g_task_run_in_thread()
+ *   guarantees that it will always run your
+ *   `task_func`, even if the task's #GCancellable
+ *   is already cancelled before the task gets a chance to run;
+ *   you can start your `task_func` with a
+ *   g_task_return_error_if_cancelled() check if you need the
+ *   old behavior.
+ * - The "return" methods (eg, g_task_return_pointer())
+ *   automatically cause the task to be "completed" as well, and
+ *   there is no need to worry about the "complete" vs "complete
+ *   in idle" distinction. (#GTask automatically figures out
+ *   whether the task's callback can be invoked directly, or
+ *   if it needs to be sent to another #GMainContext, or delayed
+ *   until the next iteration of the current #GMainContext.)
+ * - The "finish" functions for #GTask based operations are generally
+ *   much simpler than #GSimpleAsyncResult ones, normally consisting
+ *   of only a single call to g_task_propagate_pointer() or the like.
+ *   Since g_task_propagate_pointer() "steals" the return value from
+ *   the #GTask, it is not necessary to juggle pointers around to
+ *   prevent it from being freed twice.
+ * - With #GSimpleAsyncResult, it was common to call
+ *   g_simple_async_result_propagate_error() from the
+ *   `_finish()` wrapper function, and have
+ *   virtual method implementations only deal with successful
+ *   returns. This behavior is deprecated, because it makes it
+ *   difficult for a subclass to chain to a parent class's async
+ *   methods. Instead, the wrapper function should just be a
+ *   simple wrapper, and the virtual method should call an
+ *   appropriate `g_task_propagate_` function.
+ *   Note that wrapper methods can now use
+ *   g_async_result_legacy_propagate_error() to do old-style
+ *   #GSimpleAsyncResult error-returning behavior, and
+ *   g_async_result_is_tagged() to check if a result is tagged as
+ *   having come from the `_async()` wrapper
+ *   function (for "short-circuit" results, such as when passing
+ *   0 to g_input_stream_read_async()).
+ *
+ * ## Thread-safety considerations
+ *
+ * Due to some infelicities in the API design, there is a
+ * thread-safety concern that users of GTask have to be aware of:
+ *
+ * If the `main` thread drops its last reference to the source object
+ * or the task data before the task is finalized, then the finalizers
+ * of these objects may be called on the worker thread.
+ *
+ * This is a problem if the finalizers use non-threadsafe API, and
+ * can lead to hard-to-debug crashes. Possible workarounds include:
+ *
+ * - Clear task data in a signal handler for `notify::completed`
+ *
+ * - Keep iterating a main context in the main thread and defer
+ *   dropping the reference to the source object to that main
+ *   context when the task is finalized

+/**
+ * SECTION:gtestdbus
+ * @short_description: D-Bus testing helper
+ * @include: gio/gio.h
+ *
+ * A helper class for testing code which uses D-Bus without touching the user's
+ * session bus.
+ *
+ * Note that #GTestDBus modifies the user’s environment, calling setenv().
+ * This is not thread-safe, so all #GTestDBus calls should be completed before
+ * threads are spawned, or should have appropriate locking to ensure no access
+ * conflicts to environment variables shared between #GTestDBus and other
+ * threads.
+ *
+ * ## Creating unit tests using GTestDBus
+ *
+ * Testing of D-Bus services can be tricky because normally we only ever run
+ * D-Bus services over an existing instance of the D-Bus daemon thus we
+ * usually don't activate D-Bus services that are not yet installed into the
+ * target system. The #GTestDBus object makes this easier for us by taking care
+ * of the lower level tasks such as running a private D-Bus daemon and looking
+ * up uninstalled services in customizable locations, typically in your source
+ * code tree.
+ *
+ * The first thing you will need is a separate service description file for the
+ * D-Bus daemon. Typically a `services` subdirectory of your `tests` directory
+ * is a good place to put this file.
+ *
+ * The service file should list your service along with an absolute path to the
+ * uninstalled service executable in your source tree. Using autotools we would
+ * achieve this by adding a file such as `my-server.service.in` in the services
+ * directory and have it processed by configure.
+ * |[
+ *     [D-BUS Service]
+ *     Name=org.gtk.GDBus.Examples.ObjectManager
+ *     Exec=@abs_top_builddir@/gio/tests/gdbus-example-objectmanager-server
+ * ]|
+ * You will also need to indicate this service directory in your test
+ * fixtures, so you will need to pass the path while compiling your
+ * test cases. Typically this is done with autotools with an added
+ * preprocessor flag specified to compile your tests such as:
+ * |[
+ *     -DTEST_SERVICES=\""$(abs_top_builddir)/tests/services"\"
+ * ]|
+ *     Once you have a service definition file which is local to your source tree,
+ * you can proceed to set up a GTest fixture using the #GTestDBus scaffolding.
+ *
+ * An example of a test fixture for D-Bus services can be found
+ * here:
+ * [gdbus-test-fixture.c](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/tests/gdbus-test-fixture.c)
+ *
+ * Note that these examples only deal with isolating the D-Bus aspect of your
+ * service. To successfully run isolated unit tests on your service you may need
+ * some additional modifications to your test case fixture. For example; if your
+ * service uses GSettings and installs a schema then it is important that your test service
+ * not load the schema in the ordinary installed location (chances are that your service
+ * and schema files are not yet installed, or worse; there is an older version of the
+ * schema file sitting in the install location).
+ *
+ * Most of the time we can work around these obstacles using the
+ * environment. Since the environment is inherited by the D-Bus daemon
+ * created by #GTestDBus and then in turn inherited by any services the
+ * D-Bus daemon activates, using the setup routine for your fixture is
+ * a practical place to help sandbox your runtime environment. For the
+ * rather typical GSettings case we can work around this by setting
+ * `GSETTINGS_SCHEMA_DIR` to the in tree directory holding your schemas
+ * in the above fixture_setup() routine.
+ *
+ * The GSettings schemas need to be locally pre-compiled for this to work. This can be achieved
+ * by compiling the schemas locally as a step before running test cases, an autotools setup might
+ * do the following in the directory holding schemas:
+ * |[
+ *     all-am:
+ *             $(GLIB_COMPILE_SCHEMAS) .
+ *
+ *     CLEANFILES += gschemas.compiled

+ *
+ * In the simplest case, for a client TLS connection, you can just set the

+ *
+ * For greater control, you can create your own #GTlsClientConnection,
+ * wrapping a #GSocketConnection (or an arbitrary #GIOStream with

+ *
+ * The #GVolume interface represents user-visible objects that can be
+ * mounted. Note, when porting from GnomeVFS, #GVolume is the moral
+ * equivalent of #GnomeVFSDrive.
+ *
+ * Mounting a #GVolume instance is an asynchronous operation. For more
+ * information about asynchronous operations, see #GAsyncResult and
+ * #GTask. To mount a #GVolume, first call g_volume_mount() with (at
+ * least) the #GVolume instance, optionally a #GMountOperation object
+ * and a #GAsyncReadyCallback.
+ *
+ * Typically, one will only want to pass %NULL for the
+ * #GMountOperation if automounting all volumes when a desktop session
+ * starts since it's not desirable to put up a lot of dialogs asking
+ * for credentials.
+ *
+ * The callback will be fired when the operation has resolved (either
+ * with success or failure), and a #GAsyncResult instance will be
+ * passed to the callback.  That callback should then call
+ * g_volume_mount_finish() with the #GVolume instance and the
+ * #GAsyncResult data to see if the operation was completed
+ * successfully.  If an @error is present when g_volume_mount_finish()
+ * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.
+ *
+ * ## Volume Identifiers # {#volume-identifier}
+ *
+ * It is sometimes necessary to directly access the underlying
+ * operating system object behind a volume (e.g. for passing a volume
+ * to an application via the commandline). For this purpose, GIO
+ * allows to obtain an 'identifier' for the volume. There can be
+ * different kinds of identifiers, such as Hal UDIs, filesystem labels,
+ * traditional Unix devices (e.g. `/dev/sda2`), UUIDs. GIO uses predefined
+ * strings as names for the different kinds of identifiers:
+ * %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UUID, %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_LABEL, etc.
+ * Use g_volume_get_identifier() to obtain an identifier for a volume.
+ *
+ *
+ * Note that %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_HAL_UDI will only be available
+ * when the gvfs hal volume monitor is in use. Other volume monitors
+ * will generally be able to provide the %G_VOLUME_IDENTIFIER_KIND_UNIX_DEVICE
+ * identifier, which can be used to obtain a hal device by means of
+ * libhal_manager_find_device_string_match().

+ * #GWin32RegistryKey represents a single Windows Registry key.
+ *
+ * #GWin32RegistryKey is used by a number of helper functions that read
+ * Windows Registry. All keys are opened with read-only access, and at

+ * new ones.
+ *
+ * #GWin32RegistryKey implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually
+ * constructed by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check
+ * the results before using the object. This is done automatically
+ * in g_win32_registry_key_new() and g_win32_registry_key_get_child(), so these
+ * functions can return %NULL.
+ *
+ * To increase efficiency, a UTF-16 variant is available for all functions
+ * that deal with key or value names in the registry. Use these to perform
+ * deep registry queries or other operations that require querying a name
+ * of a key or a value and then opening it (or querying its data). The use
+ * of UTF-16 functions avoids the overhead of converting names to UTF-8 and
+ * back.
+ *
+ * All functions operate in current user's context (it is not possible to
+ * access registry tree of a different user).
+ *
+ * Key paths must use '\\' as a separator, '/' is not supported. Key names
+ * must not include '\\', because it's used as a separator. Value names
+ * can include '\\'.
+ *
+ * Key and value names are not case sensitive.
+ *
+ * Full key name (excluding the pre-defined ancestor's name) can't exceed
+ * 255 UTF-16 characters, give or take. Value name can't exceed 16383 UTF-16

+ * point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by @arg_data
+ * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
+ *
+ * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
+ * @arg_data for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
+ * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
+ * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
+ * inspected and modified.  If %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is
+ * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
+ * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
+ * As it has been passed outside the process at this point, the types of all
+ * values in the options dict must be checked before being used.
+ * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
+ * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
+ * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
+ * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
+ *
+ * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
+ * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
+ * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
+ * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
+ * possible to either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and
+ * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
+ *
+ * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
+ * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
+ * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
+ * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
+ * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
+ * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
+ * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
+ *
+ * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
+ * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
+ * @arg_data is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
+ * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
+ * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
+ * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
+ * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
+ *
+ * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
+ * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
+ * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use `b`
+ * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use `&s`
+ * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use `i`

+ * For convenience, the restrictions on application identifiers are
+ * reproduced here:
+ *
+ * - Application identifiers are composed of 1 or more elements separated by a
+ *   period (`.`) character. All elements must contain at least one character.
+ *
+ * - Each element must only contain the ASCII characters `[A-Z][a-z][0-9]_-`,
+ *   with `-` discouraged in new application identifiers. Each element must not
+ *   begin with a digit.
+ *
+ * - Application identifiers must contain at least one `.` (period) character
+ *   (and thus at least two elements).
+ *
+ * - Application identifiers must not begin with a `.` (period) character.
+ *
+ * - Application identifiers must not exceed 255 characters.
+ *
+ * Note that the hyphen (`-`) character is allowed in application identifiers,
+ * but is problematic or not allowed in various specifications and APIs that
+ * refer to D-Bus, such as
+ * [Flatpak application IDs](http://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/introduction.html#identifiers),
+ * the
+ * [`DBusActivatable` interface in the Desktop Entry Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#dbus),
+ * and the convention that an application's "main" interface and object path
+ * resemble its application identifier and bus name. To avoid situations that
+ * require special-case handling, it is recommended that new application
+ * identifiers consistently replace hyphens with underscores.
+ *
+ * Like D-Bus interface names, application identifiers should start with the
+ * reversed DNS domain name of the author of the interface (in lower-case), and
+ * it is conventional for the rest of the application identifier to consist of
+ * words run together, with initial capital letters.
+ *
+ * As with D-Bus interface names, if the author's DNS domain name contains
+ * hyphen/minus characters they should be replaced by underscores, and if it
+ * contains leading digits they should be escaped by prepending an underscore.
+ * For example, if the owner of 7-zip.org used an application identifier for an

+ * required.  Note that on Windows, @argc and @argv are ignored, and
+ * g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
+ * of Unicode commandline arguments).
+ *
+ * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
+ * can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
+ * g_application_add_main_option_entries().  After this, the
+ * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the

+ *
+ * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options

+ * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
+ * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
+ * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
+ * the process.
+ *
+ * What happens next depends on the flags: if
+ * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
+ * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
+ * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
+ * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
+ * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
+ * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
+ * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
+ * via the #GApplication::open signal.
+ *
+ * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
+ * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
+ * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
+ * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to

+ * for an example.
+ *
+ * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
+ * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
+ * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
+ * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
+ *
+ * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
+ * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
+ * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
+ * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
+ * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in

+ * As an example, if the application has an ID of "org.example.app" then

+/**
+ * g_converter_convert:
+ * @converter: a #GConverter.
+ * @inbuf: (array length=inbuf_size) (element-type guint8): the buffer
+ *         containing the data to convert.
+ * @inbuf_size: the number of bytes in @inbuf
+ * @outbuf: (element-type guint8) (array length=outbuf_size) (not nullable): a
+ *    buffer to write converted data in.
+ * @outbuf_size: the number of bytes in @outbuf, must be at least one
+ * @flags: a #GConverterFlags controlling the conversion details
+ * @bytes_read: (out) (not nullable): will be set to the number of bytes read
+ *    from @inbuf on success
+ * @bytes_written: (out) (not nullable): will be set to the number of bytes
+ *    written to @outbuf on success
+ * @error: location to store the error occurring, or %NULL to ignore
+ *
+ * This is the main operation used when converting data. It is to be called
+ * multiple times in a loop, and each time it will do some work, i.e.
+ * producing some output (in @outbuf) or consuming some input (from @inbuf) or
+ * both. If its not possible to do any work an error is returned.
+ *
+ * Note that a single call may not consume all input (or any input at all).
+ * Also a call may produce output even if given no input, due to state stored
+ * in the converter producing output.
+ *
+ * If any data was either produced or consumed, and then an error happens, then
+ * only the successful conversion is reported and the error is returned on the
+ * next call.
+ *
+ * A full conversion loop involves calling this method repeatedly, each time
+ * giving it new input and space output space. When there is no more input
+ * data after the data in @inbuf, the flag %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END must be set.
+ * The loop will be (unless some error happens) returning %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED
+ * each time until all data is consumed and all output is produced, then
+ * %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned instead. Note, that %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED
+ * may be returned even if %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is not set, for instance
+ * in a decompression converter where the end of data is detectable from the
+ * data (and there might even be other data after the end of the compressed data).
+ *
+ * When some data has successfully been converted @bytes_read and is set to
+ * the number of bytes read from @inbuf, and @bytes_written is set to indicate
+ * how many bytes was written to @outbuf. If there are more data to output
+ * or consume (i.e. unless the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END is specified) then
+ * %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED is returned, and if no more data is to be output
+ * then %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED is returned.
+ *
+ * On error %G_CONVERTER_ERROR is returned and @error is set accordingly.
+ * Some errors need special handling:
+ *
+ * %G_IO_ERROR_NO_SPACE is returned if there is not enough space
+ * to write the resulting converted data, the application should
+ * call the function again with a larger @outbuf to continue.
+ *
+ * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT is returned if there is not enough
+ * input to fully determine what the conversion should produce,
+ * and the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag is not set. This happens for
+ * example with an incomplete multibyte sequence when converting text,
+ * or when a regexp matches up to the end of the input (and may match
+ * further input). It may also happen when @inbuf_size is zero and
+ * there is no more data to produce.
+ *
+ * When this happens the application should read more input and then
+ * call the function again. If further input shows that there is no
+ * more data call the function again with the same data but with
+ * the %G_CONVERTER_INPUT_AT_END flag set. This may cause the conversion
+ * to finish as e.g. in the regexp match case (or, to fail again with
+ * %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT in e.g. a charset conversion where the
+ * input is actually partial).
+ *
+ * After g_converter_convert() has returned %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED the
+ * converter object is in an invalid state where its not allowed
+ * to call g_converter_convert() anymore. At this time you can only
+ * free the object or call g_converter_reset() to reset it to the
+ * initial state.
+ *
+ * If the flag %G_CONVERTER_FLUSH is set then conversion is modified
+ * to try to write out all internal state to the output. The application
+ * has to call the function multiple times with the flag set, and when
+ * the available input has been consumed and all internal state has
+ * been produced then %G_CONVERTER_FLUSHED (or %G_CONVERTER_FINISHED if
+ * really at the end) is returned instead of %G_CONVERTER_CONVERTED.
+ * This is somewhat similar to what happens at the end of the input stream,
+ * but done in the middle of the data.
+ *
+ * This has different meanings for different conversions. For instance
+ * in a compression converter it would mean that we flush all the
+ * compression state into output such that if you uncompress the
+ * compressed data you get back all the input data. Doing this may
+ * make the final file larger due to padding though. Another example
+ * is a regexp conversion, where if you at the end of the flushed data
+ * have a match, but there is also a potential longer match. In the
+ * non-flushed case we would ask for more input, but when flushing we
+ * treat this as the end of input and do the match.
+ *
+ * Flushing is not always possible (like if a charset converter flushes
+ * at a partial multibyte sequence). Converters are supposed to try
+ * to produce as much output as possible and then return an error
+ * (typically %G_IO_ERROR_PARTIAL_INPUT).
+ *
+ * Returns: a #GConverterResult, %G_CONVERTER_ERROR on error.

+ * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
+ * of the thread you are calling this method from.
+ *
+ * If @connection is not a message bus connection, @sender must be
+ * %NULL.
+ *
+ * If @sender is a well-known name note that @callback is invoked with
+ * the unique name for the owner of @sender, not the well-known name
+ * as one would expect. This is because the message bus rewrites the
+ * name. As such, to avoid certain race conditions, users should be
+ * tracking the name owner of the well-known name and use that when
+ * processing the received signal.
+ *
+ * If one of %G_DBUS_SIGNAL_FLAGS_MATCH_ARG0_NAMESPACE or
+ * %G_DBUS_SIGNAL_FLAGS_MATCH_ARG0_PATH are given, @arg0 is
+ * interpreted as part of a namespace or path.  The first argument

+ * If @user_data_free_func is non-%NULL, it will be called (in the
+ * thread-default main context of the thread you are calling this
+ * method from) at some point after @user_data is no longer
+ * needed. (It is not guaranteed to be called synchronously when the
+ * signal is unsubscribed from, and may be called after @connection
+ * has been destroyed.)
+ *
+ * As @callback is potentially invoked in a different thread from where it’s
+ * emitted, it’s possible for this to happen after
+ * g_dbus_connection_signal_unsubscribe() has been called in another thread.
+ * Due to this, @user_data should have a strong reference which is freed with
+ * @user_data_free_func, rather than pointing to data whose lifecycle is tied
+ * to the signal subscription. For example, if a #GObject is used to store the
+ * subscription ID from g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe(), a strong reference
+ * to that #GObject must be passed to @user_data, and g_object_unref() passed to
+ * @user_data_free_func. You are responsible for breaking the resulting
+ * reference count cycle by explicitly unsubscribing from the signal when
+ * dropping the last external reference to the #GObject. Alternatively, a weak
+ * reference may be used.
+ *
+ * It is guaranteed that if you unsubscribe from a signal using
+ * g_dbus_connection_signal_unsubscribe() from the same thread which made the
+ * corresponding g_dbus_connection_signal_subscribe() call, @callback will not
+ * be invoked after g_dbus_connection_signal_unsubscribe() returns.

+ * Initializes the object implementing the interface.

+ * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
+ * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
+ *
+ * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
+ * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
+ *
+ * Implementations may also support cancellation. If @cancellable is not %NULL,
+ * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
+ * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
+ * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If @cancellable is not %NULL and

+ *
+ * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
+ * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
+ * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
+ * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
+ *
+ * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
+ * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
+ * supporting this. Generally, a class’ implementation of init() can assume
+ * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
+ * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
+ * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
+ *
+ * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
+ * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
+ * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
+ * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
+ *
+ * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
+ * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
+ * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
+ * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
+ * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new

+ * The effect of having one menu appear as a section of another is

+ * Visual separation is typically displayed between two non-empty
+ * sections.  If @label is non-%NULL then it will be encorporated into

+ *
+ * As a simple example, consider a typical "Edit" menu from a simple

+ * a separator, followed by "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste".
+ *
+ * This would be accomplished by creating three #GMenu instances.  The
+ * first would be populated with the "Undo" and "Redo" items, and the
+ * second with the "Cut", "Copy" and "Paste" items.  The first and
+ * second menus would then be added as submenus of the third.  In XML

+ * mind that the 'link' element defines a new menu that is linked to the
+ * containing one).  The style of the second example is more verbose and

+ * Beware that due to the way that TCP works, it is possible for

+ * send something to you after you close the socket but before it has

+ * and then wait for the client to notice this and close its side of the

+ *
+ * In case of any error (including cancellation), %FALSE will be

+ *
+ * @chain is a chain of #GTlsCertificate objects each pointing to the next
+ * certificate in the chain by its #GTlsCertificate:issuer property.
+ *
+ * @purpose describes the purpose (or usage) for which the certificate
+ * is being used. Typically @purpose will be set to %G_TLS_DATABASE_PURPOSE_AUTHENTICATE_SERVER
+ * which means that the certificate is being used to authenticate a server
+ * (and we are acting as the client).
+ *
+ * The @identity is used to ensure the server certificate is valid for
+ * the expected peer identity. If the identity does not match the
+ * certificate, %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_BAD_IDENTITY will be set in the
+ * return value. If @identity is %NULL, that bit will never be set in
+ * the return value. The peer identity may also be used to check for
+ * pinned certificates (trust exceptions) in the database. These may
+ * override the normal verification process on a host-by-host basis.
+ *
+ * Currently there are no @flags, and %G_TLS_DATABASE_VERIFY_NONE should be
+ * used.
+ *
+ * If @chain is found to be valid, then the return value will be 0. If
+ * @chain is found to be invalid, then the return value will indicate at
+ * least one problem found. If the function is unable to determine
+ * whether @chain is valid (for example, because @cancellable is
+ * triggered before it completes) then the return value will be
+ * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_GENERIC_ERROR and @error will be set accordingly.
+ * @error is not set when @chain is successfully analyzed but found to
+ * be invalid.
+ *
+ * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, at least one
+ * error will be set in the return value, but it does not guarantee
+ * that all possible errors will be set. Accordingly, you may not safely
+ * decide to ignore any particular type of error. For example, it would
+ * be incorrect to mask %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow
+ * expired certificates, because this could potentially be the only
+ * error flag set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
+ *
+ * Prior to GLib 2.48, GLib's default TLS backend modified @chain to
+ * represent the certification path built by #GTlsDatabase during
+ * certificate verification by adjusting the #GTlsCertificate:issuer
+ * property of each certificate in @chain. Since GLib 2.48, this no
+ * longer occurs, so you cannot rely on #GTlsCertificate:issuer to
+ * represent the actual certification path used during certificate
+ * verification.
+ *
+ * Because TLS session context is not used, #GTlsDatabase may not
+ * perform as many checks on the certificates as #GTlsConnection would.
+ * For example, certificate constraints may not be honored, and
+ * revocation checks may not be performed. The best way to verify TLS
+ * certificates used by a TLS connection is to let #GTlsConnection
+ * handle the verification.
+ *
+ * The TLS backend may attempt to look up and add missing certificates
+ * to the chain. This may involve HTTP requests to download missing
+ * certificates.

Subject: [PATCH 4/4] tests: Do not use PYTHONPATH to import giscanner

The PYTHONPATH environment variable will prepend its contents to
sys.path; since giscanner contains an ast sub-module, we are going to
cause a collision with Python's own ast module. In some cases, Python
3.12's distutils compatibility shim will try to import Python's ast,
which will end up trying to import giscanner.ast instead.

Instead of prepending the giscanner build directory, we can append it,
and keep the current project layout.

See: #429
