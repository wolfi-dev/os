  # k3s embedds a lot of useful components (containerd, kubectl, etc...) in a
  # very efficient manner that can't be replicated with external runtime
  # components. To ensure we have an optimally packaged k3s, we try to mimic
  # as much of the upstream k3s space savings while still building all the
  # components from source. We use some light sed surgery instead of
  # maintaining patches for every version. Ultimately this means Wolfi's
  # version of k3s should feel identical to upstream (with containerd,
  # kubectl, crictl, etc...) all embedded, but with Wolfi variants where
