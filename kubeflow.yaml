# Please note that kubeflow is in pipeline to move its components and then we might have to refactor this in future updates https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow/issues/7549
# Also, similarly in test scripts, they are going to move manifests from apps directory to applications directory in a future release https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/pull/3167
# Please update the script for CRDs and other manifest then.
# This package contains all go kubeflow controllers and components.
