Subject: [PATCH] Lossless decomp: Range-limit 12-bit samples

12-bit is the only data precision for which the range of the sample data
type exceeds the valid sample range, so it is possible to craft a 12-bit
lossless JPEG image that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples.
Attempting to decompress such an image using color quantization or merged
upsampling (NOTE: libjpeg-turbo cannot generate YCbCr or subsampled
lossless JPEG images, but it can decompress them) caused segfaults or
buffer overruns when those algorithms attempted to use the out-of-range
sample values as array indices.  This commit modifies the lossless
decompressor so that it range-limits the output of the scaler when using
12-bit samples.

+2. Fixed various segfaults and buffer overruns that occurred when attempting to
+decompress various specially-crafted malformed 12-bit-per-component lossless
+JPEG images.  These issues were caused by out-of-range sample values that were
+not range-limited before being used as array indices.  The issues were specific
+to 12-bit data precision, since that is the only data precision for which the
+range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample range.
