# This update section is little wonky because the upstream repo uses two styles
# of tags for versions. There are two releases, one that is for `cabextract`,
# and another for `libmspack`.
# The libmspack are of the form `v0.11alpha` while the cabextract ones are
# of the form `v1.11`.
# So, for now we only consider the alpha tags for libmspack itself.
