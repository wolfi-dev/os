#
# WARNING: Due to the way logstash loads plugins we have to load this package
#          at build time. That means the logstash package must be rebuilt to
#          pick up changes from this package. Simply building and publishing
#          a new version of this package is not enough to land changes.
#
# tl;dr: If you're touching this package please also rebuild logstash!!
