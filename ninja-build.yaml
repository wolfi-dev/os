# Note that there's also samurai that provides ninja. It's typically a better
# option given how it schedules jobs more predictably. For one example where
# this was a problem in the upstream package:
# https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os/issues/7334
# `ninja` gets installed into /usr/lib/ninja-build/bin/ninja to follow precedent
# from alpine, so that it doesn't conflict with samurai. In order to use this
# for builds, you have to install this package, as well as add
# `/usr/lib/ninja-build/bin` to your PATH.
