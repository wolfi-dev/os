      # The build files because there's a Werror and there are unused functions.
      # Best guess is that their release was created with an older version
      # of gcc, which didn't consider that a failure. Because we build this from
      # a script, we can't just set CFLAGS, so we have to edit the script.
      # Note. This also modifies the make clean target, but since we do not use
      # it, it is not a problem.
