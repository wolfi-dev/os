Subject: Replace deprecated pipes.quote with shlex.quote in Chromium build_utils.py for Python 3.12+ compatibility
Upstream: Partial (Chromium has similar fixes in newer versions)
Origin: Wolfi OS maintainers (pattern from upstream Chromium updates)
Author: Wolfi OS Maintainers

The pipes module was deprecated in Python 3.11 and removed in Python 3.12.
QtWebEngine 5.15.17 (Chromium 87) build_utils.py still uses pipes.quote()
even though it already imports shlex. This patch replaces pipes.quote()
with shlex.quote() on line 201.

The shlex module provides identical functionality to pipes.quote() via
shlex.quote(), and has been the recommended replacement since Python 3.3.

This build_utils.py file is located in Chromium's Android build utilities
but is also used by the QtWebEngine build system for generating credits/licenses.
