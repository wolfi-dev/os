Subject: Replace deprecated pipes module with shlex in Chromium build_utils.py for Python 3.12+ compatibility
Upstream: Partial (Chromium has similar fixes in newer versions)
Origin: Wolfi OS maintainers (pattern from upstream Chromium updates)
Author: Wolfi OS Maintainers

The pipes module was deprecated in Python 3.11 and removed in Python 3.12.
QtWebEngine 5.15.x uses Chromium 87 which contains build utilities that use
the pipes module. This patch replaces `import pipes` with `import shlex` and
`pipes.quote()` with `shlex.quote()` in build_utils.py, which is used during
the Chromium build process to generate license information.

The shlex module provides identical functionality to pipes.quote() via
shlex.quote(), and has been the recommended replacement since Python 3.3.

This build_utils.py file is located in Chromium's Android build utilities
but is also used by the QtWebEngine build system for generating credits/licenses.
