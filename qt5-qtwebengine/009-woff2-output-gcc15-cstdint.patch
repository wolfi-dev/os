Subject: Add missing cstdint include to woff2 output.h for GCC 15 compatibility
Upstream: No (GCC 15 compatibility fix for Chromium 87)
Origin: Wolfi OS maintainers
Author: Wolfi OS Maintainers

GCC 15 requires explicit inclusion of <cstdint> for uint8_t and other integer types.
QtWebEngine 5.15.x uses Chromium 87 which contains woff2 code that uses uint8_t
without including <cstdint>.

This patch adds the missing #include <cstdint> to output.h to fix compilation
errors with GCC 15.

Error without this patch:
  error: expected ')' before '*' token
  in: third_party/woff2/include/woff2/output.h:73:25
  note: 'uint8_t' is defined in header '<cstdint>'

This is part of a series of GCC 15 compatibility fixes (patches 001-004, 008-009).
