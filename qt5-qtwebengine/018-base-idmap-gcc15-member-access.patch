Subject: Fix IDMap Iterator member access for GCC 15 compatibility
Upstream: No
Origin: Wolfi OS (GCC 15 compatibility fix)
Author: Wolfi OS Maintainers

GCC 15 has stricter template name resolution. The IDMap::Iterator copy assignment
operator was accessing member variables without trailing underscores (map, iter)
but the actual member variable names have trailing underscores (map_, iter_).

Fix by changing member access to use the correct member variable names with
trailing underscores.
