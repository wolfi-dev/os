Subject: Add missing cstdint include for GCC 15 compatibility in gpu_fence_manager.h
Upstream: No
Origin: Wolfi OS (GCC 15 compatibility fix)
Author: Wolfi OS Maintainers

GCC 15 no longer implicitly includes <cstdint>, which causes uint32_t
to be undeclared in Chromium's GPU fence manager header. This leads to
type mismatch errors where the compiler interprets uint32_t as int.
