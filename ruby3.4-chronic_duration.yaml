package:
  name: ruby3.4-chronic_duration
  version: 0.10.6
  epoch: 2
  description: A simple Ruby natural language parser for elapsed time. (For example, 4 hours and 30 minutes, 6 minutes 4 seconds, 3 days, etc.) Returns all results in seconds. Will return an integer unless you get tricky and need a float. (4 minutes and 13.47 seconds, for example.) The reverse can also be performed via the output method.

  # Upstream pin to an eol version of `numerizer` as a runtime dependency. This
  # results in runtime failures when we attempt to use our (newer) version.
  # This patch removes upstream pinning to a particular version at runtime.
  #
  # There hasn't been any updates for quite some time upstream, so there doesn't
  # look to be any other reason for the pinning.
