      # In the cert bundle that current version of trust-manager used, there
      # is a cert that will produce a negative serial number, which is disallowed
      # on Go 1.23. According to https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509#ParseCertificate,
      # the Go 1.22 behavior can be restored using GODEBUG=x509negativeserial=1.

      # We should revert this change when upstream fixes their cert bundle.
